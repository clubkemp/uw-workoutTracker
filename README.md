  ## Usage
  Start by addinga workout, to do this type a name in the top input and use the + button. You will see your new workout in the top of the list. From there you can use your first exercise as a template and edit that card OR create new exercises to associate with that workout. You may at any time also delete workouts using the yellow trashcan, or delete exercises from the workout itself.
